<h2>A biodiversity information hub for cooperative environmental monitoring in South Africa</h2>
<p>The world is firmly cemented in a notitian age (Latin: notitia, meaning data) - drowning in data, yet thirsty for information and 
the synthesis of knowledge into understanding. The volume, diversity and speed at which new ecological data are generated is 
growing exponentially as concerns over biodiversity decline escalate worldwide. Those able to successfully generate, collect, 
store, share, analyse and communicate the existence of synthesised biodiversity data will become central players in the debate 
around global biodiversity change. Africa is poised to become a world leader in biodiversity conservation, as it safeguards some 
of the largest wilderness areas and intact ecosystems in the world. Here, we discuss challenges, highlight opportunities and encourage 
innovative solutions for biodiversity informatics in South Africa (SA), with relevance for expanded African efforts. 
We propose the development of a South African Biodiversity Informatics Hub and describe the essential components for successful 
system design, implementation and sustainability.</p>

<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
<br>Proposed workshop outcomes:

<li>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
<li>bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb.
<li>cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc.
<li>ddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd.
</ol></p>
<p>We emphasise the importance of developing a culture of cooperation and interoperability among custodians of data to establish 
operational workflows for data synthesis. We argue that the biggest challenge facing biodiversity informatics in SA are misgivings 
around data sharing and multidisciplinary collaboration that will leverage combined expertise and datasets. 
Overall, we recommend a system that is free, user friendly, functional, stable, integrative and designed to cater for different data 
access agreement levels. In this way, multiple stakeholders and decision-makers will have access to valuable biodiversity data that 
feed results back into a national system to support research and biodiversity plans.</p>
